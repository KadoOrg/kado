# Interfaces


Kado implements a variety of interfaces than can be enabled optionally as they are needed. A brief list of these interfaces.

* admin
* cli
* main

Now that I have introduced the interfaces lets go over what they will all do.

### Admin

The admin panel will control how the system functions. Admin modules will provide internal and staff only functionality.

### CLI

The bin interface encompasses the Kado script system. Allowing Kado users to access different parts of the system through command line to run scripts and perform maintenance on the Kado installation itself or the modules.

### Main

Any company has a public facing website and this section of Kado is specifically tailored to provide a public website. The wonderful part about Kado is that each interface is completely full featured and modular.

## Listening Ports

Just to get it out of the way early, lets go over the listening ports that are setup by default for the Kado interfaces.

* admin - HTTP: 3000
* bin - none (command line only, maybe tty0 :)
* main - HTTP: 3001

In production I recommend leaving these port numbers as they are however assign a separate localhost IP to each instance of Kado. For example, 127.0.2.1 for instance 1, 127.0.2.2 for instance 2. Before you ask, yes this works completely without issue on linux. 127.0.0.0/8 is routed to localhost loopback according to some RFC.
