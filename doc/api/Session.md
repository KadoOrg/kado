The `Session` library provides both the means for creating middleware to load
save and prune sessions. There is also a `SessionStoreMemory` for storing
sessions locally to memory within a single process. As well as a full suite
of `SessionStoreLocal` and `SessionStorage` for implementing a client to server
relationship for saving and restoring sessions.
