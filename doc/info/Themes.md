# Themes
> NOTICE: Kado 3 is **DEPRECATED**, see [kado.org](https://kado.org) for the latest version.

Kado ships with a very clean, modern and responsive template that works well on
most any device. A style sheet can be applied to the default template to create
a very respectable website. However, more often than not, it is more desirable
to use a complete theme or try a couple themes and ultimately end up tweaking
one to your liking.

Here at Kado we love that process and support it full out. Every portion of Kado
can be overridden to provide complete control over styling. That goes from the
Admin interface to the Main interface and even the CLI systems. Kado comes
complete with Breadcrumb, Language Packs, URI Interpolation and a View Manager
to make dynamic styling a breeze.
